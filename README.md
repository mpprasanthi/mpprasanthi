About me : Sai Prashanthi Manicka Premchand

I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science & Engineering where I developed a strong foundation in statistical analysis and data manipulation.
I bring 5 years of professional experience in IT, having previously worked at TEKsystem Global Services as a Data Analyst where I worked for their analytics team to transform the internal raw data into meaningful insights using tools and technologies, such as SQL, Python & Snowflake, and leveraging data as per the client requirement.
I am passionate about working with large datasets, querying them using SQL to extract the required data, transforming them to the required format by doing data cleansing & finally loading them back for dashboarding purposes using the Tableau data visualization tool. 
Being detail oriented helps me to isolate the problems & find ways to improve them.
