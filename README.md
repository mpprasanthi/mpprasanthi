About me : Sai Prashanthi Manicka Premchand

I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science & Engineering where I developed a strong foundation in statistical analysis and data manipulation.
I bring 5 years of professional experience in IT, having previously worked at TEKsystem Global Services as a **Data Analyst** where I worked for their analytics team to transform the internal raw data into meaningful insights using tools and technologies, such as **SQL**, **Python** & **Snowflake**, and leveraging data as per the client requirement.

Currently, I am pursuing Amazon's Silver Lining program to become a cloud engineer by working on different AWS services including EC2 instance, S3 buckets, building 3-tier web applications along with the automation, deployment & provisioning in AWS.

Volunteering for a Catchafire client to identify a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Audit system to provide recommendations on improvements such as setup, maintenance, integrations with other systems, and insights reporting with a goal of saving $3,315 to maximize their usage of Kindful CRM subscription.

I am passionate about working with large datasets, querying them using SQL to extract the required data, transforming them to the required format by doing data cleansing & finally loading them back for dashboarding purposes using the **Tableau** data visualization tool. 
Being detail oriented helps me to isolate the problems & find ways to improve them.
